# Module 3 Python Challenge for UTA Data Analysis Bootcamp

For this assignment, we were tasked with reading in some csv files and analyzing the data contained within the files.<br>

<h1>PyBank</h1>

For this section, we had to create a Python script that analyzes the financial records of a company. <br>

&emsp;From this data, we had to determine several values: the total number of months in the dataset, the net total amount of Profits and Losses for the entire time frame, the changes in Profits and Losses over the time frame (and then the average of those changes), and both the greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits over the time frame. After this is all done, the script should output to the console and export a text file with the results.

<h1>PyPoll</h1>

&emsp;For the PyPoll portion, we had to create a Python script to analyze some voting data to help a small town modernize its vote-counting process.

&emsp;From this data, we again had to determine several values: the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates that received votes, the percentage of votes that each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate received, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. After this is all done, the script should output to the console and export a text file with the results.

<h1>Difficulties/Sources</h1>

&emsp;I had a few issues remembering/utilizing proper syntax to get the code to do what I wanted. I utlized ChatGPT (though I am straying away from this as recommended) and StackOverflow for both PyBank and PyPoll assignments. I also used a chunk of code from classmate Tim Cole to determine the winner with code (I had originally written it to just output the winner based on my own knowledge of the popular vote winner and inserting their name into the script).

&emsp;For the PyBank portion, I needed help with figuring out how to loop through the Profits/Losses column so that I could find the difference between rows. I also needed help with the specific syntax for writing to a text file while adding page breaks.

&emsp; For the PyPoll portion, I needed help with the syntax for checking if a string value was present in a list and adding that value to the list if it wasn't already in it.

&emsp;All of these sources are called out in the comments above the line(s) of code it helped me with.
